## How to use the todo list project

- To add a task just hover over and click on the add task text field
and just press the enter key. 

- If you want to mark an item as done, just hover over onto the
item and click the item and it will mark it as done. 

- If you want to move an item that is done, back to not done,
just click on the item.

- If you want to delete an item from the list just click the "X"
 on the right of the task. 

- If you want to filter to only see done or not done just click
the radio button at the top right corner of the webpage and press
the filter button.

    - If no button is selected, by default it will show all tasks.
    

- If you want to see all the items again, either click the all
option in the filer area OR click the home button on the top 
left of the page.

## Above and beyond: Search functionality
- To search for a task there is a search text box in the top left corner. To submit your search either press enter or the magnifying glass. 
- When you search for something, the search term will show up at the top of the page saying, " Results for 'term' " and if there is no results it will say "no results found". 
- All the found results will be listed and seperated based on completion underneath the message. 
- To get out of search mode just click the home button on the top left corner.
